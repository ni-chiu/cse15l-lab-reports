## Installing VScode
To install VSCode, I nagivated to the [Visual Studio Code site](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and downloaded the version corresponding to my operating system (Windows). There are also versions for all other major operating systems.

## Remotely Connecting
Since I am on Windows, I had to navigate to [this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse) to install Open SSH on my machine. Then, in VSCode, I opened a terminal window from the Terminal tab and used the command:
$ ssh cs15lsp22afz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
